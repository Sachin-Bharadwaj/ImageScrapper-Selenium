# ImageScrapper-Selenium

This an app for scraping images using google wherein we just want to automatically scrape web for images.  This comes in handy when we want to build our own pipeline for object detection, localization use cases. The app uses Selenium to control the chrome and issues the search command and automatically saves the images in the static folder as well as shows the scraped results to the user in browser.

`NOTE`: Please change the chrome web driver to match your chrome browser version otherwise they will not be compatible while using Selenium.
